My name is Dominic Celiano, and this is my home on the Internet.

This website also includes some of my work, including my blog, entitled "Dom's Tech Blog".

# About Me
You can find a lot out about me by looking at the social media links on my homepage.

You can also see my Yahoo Answers profile [here](https://answers.yahoo.com/activity/answers?show=S2SJSJIJ5ANVL3I3Y4ZY5OMDSQ&amp;t=g), where I used to answer math and physics questions.
