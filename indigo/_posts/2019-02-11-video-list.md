One way I like to spend my time is watching videos online. Over the years, I have compiled a list of videos I enjoy and might be enjoyable to others, too.

I have organized the videos (and channels) into categories below. Most content comes from Youtube and was exported from my "Liked Videos" playlist using <a href= "https://sourceforge.net/projects/youtubeexport/">Youtube Export</a>. Then, I manually moved all my video URLs into the categories below and used a <a href="https://github.com/domcc3/url_organizer">script</a> to create this webpage. Please note that all the links will open in a new window.
